# Donations

> ## Why I'm asking for your support
> 
> Although wufuc's code is relatively small, its reach has become quite large, having many users all across the world. Making it work smoothly in all kinds of different computing environments, from being installed by casual users to being deployed across large enterprise-scale domains, has turned out to be a very time-consuming task.
> 
> ### A little backstory
> 
> When I wrote the first iteration of wufuc (then known as [kb4012218-19](https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc/tree/old-kb4012218-19)) and published it on GitHub, I originally had intended for it to simply be a proof-of-concept that others could learn from. I had no way of anticipating that around April 18, 2017, several high-profile tech and gaming news websites would publish dozens of articles about my project, sending huge amounts of traffic to it.
> 
> ### Many sleepless nights later
> 
> It has now been over a year since I began this project, and since then it has undergone several major iterations. Thanks to the many hours I have spent doing research, writing and improving its code, I have learned a great deal that I likely would not have otherwise.
> 
> ### There is still reality to contend with
> 
> I glean no direct monetary benefit from this project, other than the contributions from generous users like you. If you're willing and able to, your support would be immensely appreciated. Contributions would be going towards my living expenses, computer upkeep, etc., so that I can spend more time doing what I love to do: making useful, free software for people like you.
> 
> Thanks for your time and consideration! Have a great day.

> _Note: Please keep in mind that donations, etc. should be considered gifts towards my past development efforts, and not made with the assumption of continued support._
